# Machine Learning Model to Predict House Price

## Introduction

This project aims to build a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices. The Jupyter notebook contains the code implementation and the steps taken to develop the predictive model. Various techniques such as scikit-learn, Lasso, L2 regularization, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding have been employed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the model.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter notebook and execute the code successfully, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3.11.3)
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn library
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AKnodel/House-Price-Prediction.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `code.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

## Dataset

The project uses one dataset:

`Housing.csv`: This file contains the raw data of house features and their corresponding prices.

## Visualization

Some plots have been made using 'matplotlib' library to better understand the raw data and also to compare the final result of the model.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `code.ipynb` and follow the step-by-step instructions to execute the code. The notebook contains detailed explanations and comments to guide you through the entire process of building the machine learning model.

## Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any bugs or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the developers of scikit-learn and other open-source libraries used in this project, as well as the community for their valuable contributions to the field of machine learning and also 'kaggle' for providing the dataset.

Happy predicting!
